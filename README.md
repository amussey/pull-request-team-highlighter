Pull Request Highlighter
========================

Highlight github pull requests from different people on your team with different colors.

This extension is designed for large organizations with lots of people working on the same github repository.  If you want to scan the list of open pull requests for your repo quickly and see what certain people are working on, this extension provides that capability.  Want everyone in your organization to by synced with the same color and naming scheme?  The extension responds with a JSON blob you can pass around your group.
